For MAE 3230, we were assigned to dissect and analyze a fluid machine. My group was assigned a propane tank, and our YouTube video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzI_s_GJoqY">here</a>. I helped in the dissection, the identification of each component in the propane tank as a fluid machine, the calculations of the mass flow rate and the velocity of the flow in the propane tank, and the final presentation. I also modeled the cross-sectional view of the propane tank.
